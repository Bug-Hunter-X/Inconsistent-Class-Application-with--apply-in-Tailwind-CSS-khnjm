# Inconsistent Class Application with @apply in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The issue is that the classes defined using `@apply` are not always applied consistently across different components or different instances of the same component.  This appears to occur intermittently and without any clear error messages.

## Bug Description
Classes defined with `@apply` in Tailwind CSS are not consistently applied. This leads to unexpected styling inconsistencies. The bug seems to be related to the order of class application or perhaps an interaction with other CSS or JavaScript code.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a simple example demonstrating the inconsistent behavior.  Run the code and observe the variations in styling.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution which uses more explicit Tailwind classes instead of relying on `@apply` in cases where inconsistency arises. For other cases, ensure your Tailwind configuration is correct and that there are no conflicts with other CSS.
